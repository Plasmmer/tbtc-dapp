Matt loves to hold a basket of cryptocurrencies, dabbling in the financial future of the world. He holds Bitcoin and Ethereum, and likes playing around with new decentralized finance like opening CDP's and providing tokens to Uniswap pools.

He just found out about this app which puts Bitcoin on Ethereum. Excited to try, he opens up the website in his browser. Reading through the instructions, he begins the process by clicking make a deposit. Immediately, Metamask pops up, asking to confirm a transaction. Clicking submit (it costs 2c), he waits.

The dialog closes and the dapp says the deposit has been requested. He clicks "continue" and now sees a QR code and a Bitcoin address. The instructions read "send 1 BTC to this address". He opens up <XYZ> app on his <ABC> and scans the code, carefully specifying the amount. Hopefully the testnet tx fees aren't too high today (jks)!



 After closing that dialog, the deposit is created. He now needs to send BTC to the address. By opening his wallet app and scanning the QR code, or copying the address, he can send the transaction.
